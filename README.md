# Random-Number-Guesser-Game BootCamp Project

## A fully functional GUESSING GAME project written in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

This Guessing Game project was built to help users relax and not just play a game but also brainstorm. Every part of this project has a sample code that shows how to do the following:

* The computer generates a random number
* The user or player is then going to guess the generated number by passing in input values into the text box.
* The user or player will have 20 attempts in total and cannot go further; otherwise, the computer will pop up a message to the player and then regenerate a random number
* The user or player can only parse in number values; otherwise, the computer will show a warning message.
* Depending on the value the user or player inputs, a message will show on the screen telling you that your value is either "too low," "too high," or "correct."
